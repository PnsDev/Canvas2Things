Canvas2Things is a simple website to translate all your Canvas ICS assignments and meetings into Things 3. Tasks are extracted for the calendar you upload and are processed into tasks. Those tasks are then grouped into projects inside of Things 3.

## FAQ

#### How do I use this?

0. Enable Things 3 URLs inside the Things 3 settings
1. Download your school calendar from Canvas. You'll know if you did it correctly if you downloaded a .ics file
2. Go to the project's [website](https://canvas2things.pns.dev/)
3. Upload your .ics file to the website
4. Let it process (usually this takes less than a second)
5. Lastly click on the Button that says 'Add to Things'
6. A new website will appear. Click on open Things 3

#### It's not working!

Make sure you're inputting a Canvas ICS and that *Things URLs* are enabled. The second step is extremely important!

#### Do I need an Apple device?

Yes, this website works on MacOS, iPadOS, and IOS. If you try this on Windows or Linux it will not work as there's no client for Things 3 on either of those platforms.

#### Do I need Things 3 installed?

As this website relies on Things 3, you will need it installed on the device. If you only have Things 3 on your iPhone just open the website there.
